# Module 9: Multimodal Feature Engineering

## Module Objective

Welcome to Module 9, where we delve into the exciting realm of **Multimodal Feature Engineering**. In the era of big data, information rarely comes in a single, neat numerical table. Instead, it often spans across various modalities: text, images, audio, and more. This module is dedicated to equipping you with the specialized techniques required to extract meaningful, predictive features from these diverse data types, enabling you to build powerful models that understand and learn from the rich tapestry of multimodal information.

### What You Will Learn:

-   **Text Feature Engineering**: Explore methods to transform unstructured text into numerical features, including Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and advanced Word Embeddings. You'll apply these to sentiment analysis tasks.
-   **Image Feature Engineering**: Learn how to extract visual features from images, from traditional techniques like Color Histograms and HOG features to leveraging deep learning with CNN Feature Extraction. Practical application will involve image classification.
-   **Audio Feature Engineering**: Discover methods to process raw audio signals into relevant features like MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and Spectral Features, enabling tasks such as sound event classification.
-   **Case Studies**: Apply these multimodal feature engineering skills to real-world datasets for IMDB movie reviews, Dogs vs. Cats image classification, and Urban Sound classification.

By the end of this module, you will be able to approach complex problems involving diverse data types, confident in your ability to transform them into a unified, rich feature set for advanced machine learning applications.
