# Module 1: Course Introduction and EDA Review

## Learning Objectives

This module serves as a foundational introduction to the data mining course and a refresher on the essential concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of a systematic approach to data analysis.
- Master the fundamental operations of the Pandas library for data manipulation.
- Utilize data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover insights.
- Conduct a basic, structured EDA on a real-world dataset.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main notebooks:

1.  **`01_pandas_basics.ipynb`**: A review of core Pandas functionalities, including data structures (Series, DataFrame), data loading, inspection, and selection.
2.  **`02_data_visualization.ipynb`**: An introduction to creating essential plots for data analysis, focusing on understanding variable distributions and relationships.
3.  **`03_exploratory_analysis.ipynb`**: A practical, step-by-step guide to performing EDA on the Titanic dataset, applying the skills learned in the previous notebooks.
