# Module 10: Data Mining Applications

## Module Objective

Welcome to Module 10, the capstone of our data mining and feature engineering journey. In this module, we will consolidate all the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired in previous modules by applying them to a variety of real-world data mining applications. This module emphasizes the end-to-end process of solving business problems using data, from understanding the problem to deploying and interpreting models.

### What You Will Learn:

-   **Association Rules Mining**: Discover hidden relationships and patterns within large datasets using algorithms like Apriori, applied to market basket analysis.
-   **Clustering Analysis**: Learn unsupervised techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN to segment data into meaningful groups, useful for customer segmentation.
-   **Tree Model Feature Importance**: Revisit tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM) to understand how they can inherently perform feature selection and provide feature importance scores, crucial for model interpretability.
-   **End-to-End Data Mining Pipeline**: Integrate all learned steps (data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation) into a cohesive workflow to solve complex predictive problems.

By the end of this module, you will be equipped to tackle diverse data mining challenges, build robust predictive models, and extract actionable insights from various data sources. This module bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical industry applications.
