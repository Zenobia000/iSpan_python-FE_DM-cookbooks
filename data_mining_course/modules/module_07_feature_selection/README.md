# Module 7: Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction

## Module Objective

Welcome to Module 7. In the world of machine learning, having a large number of features is not always a good thing. It can lead to overfitting, increased computational cost, and decreased model interpretability. This module focuses on the crucial step of **Feature Selection** and **Dimensionality Reduction**, teaching you how to select the most relevant features and create more compact, powerful feature representations.

### What You Will Learn:

-   **Filter Methods**: Understand and apply statistical techniques (like correlation, Chi-Squared, ANOVA) to select features based on their intrinsic properties, independent of any machine learning algorithm.
-   **Wrapper Methods**: Learn how to use a specific machine learning model to "wrap" around the feature selection process, evaluating subsets of features based on model performance (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination).
-   **Embedded Methods**: Discover how some models perform feature selection inherently as part of their training process (e.g., LASSO regularization, tree-based feature importance).
-   **Dimensionality Reduction**: Explore techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE that transform features into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.
-   **Practical Application**: Apply these diverse techniques to a real-world dataset (Breast Cancer dataset) to see how they impact model performance and efficiency.

By the end of this module, you will be equipped with a comprehensive toolkit to refine your feature set, leading to more robust, efficient, and interpretable machine learning models.
