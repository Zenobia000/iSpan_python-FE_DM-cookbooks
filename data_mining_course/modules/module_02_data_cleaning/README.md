# Module 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Review

## Learning Objectives

This module provides a review of essential data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, which are foundational steps in any data science project. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Efficiently handle large datasets by reading and processing them in chunks.
- Identify and manage duplicate records within a dataset.
- Correctly convert data types to ensure data integrity and compatibility with machine learning models.
- Apply basic cleaning techniques to textual data.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into four main notebooks, each addressing a specific data cleaning challenge:

1.  **`01_chunking_large_files.ipynb`**: Demonstrates how to use the `chunksize` parameter in Pandas to process files that are too large to fit into memory.
2.  **`02_handling_duplicates.ipynb`**: Covers methods for detecting and removing duplicate rows.
3.  **`03_data_type_conversion.ipynb`**: Explains the importance of correct data types and shows how to convert them.
4.  **`04_text_cleaning.ipynb`**: Introduces fundamental text cleaning operations, such as removing punctuation and converting to lowercase.
